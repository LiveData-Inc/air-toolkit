# Task: Consolidate pytest Config to pyproject.toml

## Date
2025-10-03 13:19 UTC

## Prompt
should the settings in pytest.ini be incorporated into the pyproject.toml?

## Actions Taken
1. Moving pytest configuration from pytest.ini to pyproject.toml

## Files Changed
- pyproject.toml - Added [tool.pytest.ini_options] section
- pytest.ini - Deleted (configuration moved to pyproject.toml)

## Outcome
âœ… Success

Successfully moved pytest settings to pyproject.toml [tool.pytest.ini_options] section
for better configuration consolidation following modern Python practices.

## Notes
Modern Python projects (PEP 518) consolidate all tool config in pyproject.toml
rather than having separate config files (.flake8, pytest.ini, etc.)
