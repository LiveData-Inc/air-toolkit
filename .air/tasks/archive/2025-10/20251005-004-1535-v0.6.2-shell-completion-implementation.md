## Prompt
Create a branch and begin work on v0.6.2 shell completion

## Goal
Implement comprehensive shell completion for bash, zsh, and fish to improve CLI usability with tab completion for commands, subcommands, and dynamic arguments (resource names, task IDs, etc.)

## Actions Taken

1. ✅ Created feature branch: feat/v0.6.2-shell-completion
2. ✅ Created completion helper functions in src/air/utils/completion.py
3. ✅ Added shell_complete to analyze, task, and pr commands
4. ✅ Created air completion command group (install/uninstall/show)
5. ✅ Registered completion command in CLI
6. ✅ Fixed import issues (removed non-existent enums module)
7. ✅ Tested completion commands (install, uninstall, show)
8. ✅ Updated documentation (CHANGELOG, README)
9. ✅ Bumped version to 0.6.2
10. ✅ All 414 tests passing

## Files Changed
- `src/air/utils/completion.py` - 6 completion helper functions (168 lines)
- `src/air/commands/completion.py` - Completion management command (305 lines)
- `src/air/commands/analyze.py` - Added completion to resource, --gap, --focus
- `src/air/commands/task.py` - Added completion to task IDs (complete, status, archive, restore)
- `src/air/commands/pr.py` - Added completion to developer resources
- `src/air/commands/__init__.py` - Added completion to exports
- `src/air/cli.py` - Registered completion command
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Added v0.6.2 section with full feature description
- `README.md` - Added Shell Completion section and commands
- `pyproject.toml` - Version 0.6.2
- `src/air/__init__.py` - Version 0.6.2

## Outcome
✅ Success

Shell completion fully implemented and tested. Users can now:
- Tab complete resource names from air-config.json
- Tab complete task IDs from .air/tasks/
- Tab complete analyzer focus types
- Tab complete developer resources for PRs
- Install completion with `air completion install`
- Works with bash, zsh, and fish shells

## Notes
Following design from task 20251005-002-1005-v0.6.2-shell-completion-design.md

Key implementation details:
- Used Click 8.1+ shell_complete parameter
- Auto-detects shell from $SHELL environment variable
- Reads dynamic data from air-config.json and .air/tasks/
- Handles errors gracefully (returns empty list on exceptions)
- Multi-shell support with different installation strategies
