# Task: Implement parallel analysis using subprocess agents

## Date
2025-10-05 22:03

## Prompt
Implement parallel analysis using subprocess agents with JSON communication

## Actions Taken
1. Created `src/air/services/analysis_worker.py` - subprocess entry point
   - run_analyzer_subprocess() function for JSON communication
   - CLI entry point for standalone execution
   - Error handling and timing instrumentation
   - Tested successfully on ng-anlx repo

2. Added AnalysisOrchestrator to `src/air/services/agent_manager.py`
   - ProcessPoolExecutor-based orchestrator
   - Progress tracking with callbacks
   - Timeout handling (5min per analyzer)
   - Result aggregation from JSON
   - reconstruct_analyzer_result() helper

3. Updated `src/air/commands/analyze.py` with --parallel support
   - Added --parallel flag (opt-in)
   - Added --workers=N option
   - _get_analyzer_list() helper function
   - Parallel/sequential code paths
   - Maintains backwards compatibility

4. Tested parallel execution
   - 5 analyzers run simultaneously
   - Results correctly aggregated
   - Findings file written atomically
   - No vendor code in results

5. Enhanced progress display for parallel mode (multiple iterations)
   - Added startup banner with Rich Panel showing repo count and mode
   - Added spinner for "Building dependency graph" at startup
   - Fixed progress bar to show individual analyzer rows
   - Changed from single progress bar to individual tasks per analyzer
   - Fixed analyzer rows disappearing after completion
   - Added overall progress bar at top (shows total % complete)
   - Individual analyzer rows now stay visible with spinners → ✓/✗
   - Each row shows: spinner while running → green ✓ with timing on success
   - Overall bar updates to 100% when all analyzers complete

## Files Changed
- `src/air/services/analysis_worker.py` - NEW subprocess worker
- `src/air/services/agent_manager.py` - Added AnalysisOrchestrator class with enhanced progress display
- `src/air/commands/analyze.py` - Added --parallel, --workers flags, startup banner, and dependency graph progress

## Outcome
✅ Success

Parallel analysis working perfectly:
- Command: `air analyze repo-name --parallel`
- Uses all CPU cores by default
- `--workers=N` limits concurrency
- Sequential remains default (backwards compatible)
- No file conflicts (single atomic write)

Test results on ng-anlx:
- 5 analyzers submitted to 16 workers
- All completed successfully
- Total time: 3.79s
- 14 findings, 0 vendor code references

## Notes
- This is v0.6.3
- Subprocess approach bypasses Python GIL
- Multi-repo parallel analysis working (`air analyze --all --parallel`)
- Progress bars show overall completion + individual analyzer status
- Spinners animate while running, replaced with ✓ (success) or ✗ (failure)
- All analyzer rows stay visible after completion
- Overall progress bar shows 100% when all analyzers complete
