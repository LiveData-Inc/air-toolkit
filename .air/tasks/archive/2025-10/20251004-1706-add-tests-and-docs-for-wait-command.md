## Date
2025-10-04 17:06

## Prompt
User: "add tests and update documentation"
Context: After implementing agent status fixes and air wait command

## Actions Taken

1. Created comprehensive integration tests for air wait command
   - tests/integration/test_wait_command.py (12 new tests)
   - Tests for --all, --agents, --timeout, --format=json flags
   - Tests for parallel workflow with wait
   - Tests for failed agent detection
   - Tests for sequential wait workflows
   - All 356 tests passing ✅ (up from 344)

2. Updated documentation:
   - ✅ Updated docs/COMMANDS.md with wait command section
   - ✅ Updated Table of Contents in COMMANDS.md
   - ✅ Updated CHANGELOG.md with complete v0.6.0 details
   - ✅ Added bug fixes section (agent status fixes)
   - ✅ Added dependencies section (psutil)
   - ✅ Added gap analysis use case examples

3. Documentation already created (previous commits):
   - docs/AGENT-COORDINATION.md - Complete guide
   - docs/examples/CLAUDE-WORKFLOW-GAP-ANALYSIS.md - Step-by-step workflow
   - docs/examples/claude-gap-analysis-pattern.md - Claude-native patterns
   - docs/examples/director-gap-analysis.md - Conceptual design
   - docs/tutorials/parallel-analysis-quickstart.md - Hands-on tutorial

## Files Changed

- `tests/integration/test_wait_command.py` - 12 new integration tests (356 total, all passing)
- `docs/COMMANDS.md` - Added air wait command documentation and updated TOC
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Complete v0.6.0 details: new commands, bug fixes, dependencies
- `.air/tasks/FUTURE-agent-interaction-design.md` - Design exploration for future features

## Outcome

✅ Success

Completed comprehensive tests and documentation for air wait command and agent coordination improvements. All 356 tests passing.

## Notes

**Test Coverage:**
- Basic functionality: --all, --agents flags work correctly
- JSON output format validated
- Timeout handling tested
- Integration with background agents verified
- Failed agent detection working
- Sequential wait calls function properly

**Documentation Updates:**
- air wait command fully documented in COMMANDS.md
- CHANGELOG.md updated with complete v0.6.0 feature list
- Bug fixes documented (agent status auto-update)
- Dependencies documented (psutil for cross-platform process management)
- Gap analysis use case added as example workflow

**Future Enhancement Noted:**

User mentioned: "Eventually we want the agents to be able to interact and ask each other questions that can be served from context."

Created design exploration in `.air/tasks/FUTURE-agent-interaction-design.md` covering:
- Shared knowledge base approach
- Message queue pattern
- Semantic search via vector DB
- Coordinator pattern (recommended starting point)
- Implementation roadmap for v0.7.0+
