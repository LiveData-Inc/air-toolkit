# Task: Rename Slash Command from /air-begin to /air-task

## Date
2025-10-05 20:41

## Prompt
User: "would /air-task make more semantic sense than /air-begin?"
Claude: Agreed, /air-task is more semantic and clear
User: "yes" (requesting the change)

## Goal
Rename the slash command from /air-begin to /air-task for better clarity.

## Rationale
- /air-begin is vague (begin what? a session? the tool?)
- /air-task clearly indicates "create a new task"
- Follows the pattern of the actual command: air task new
- More discoverable and self-explanatory

## Actions Taken
1. ✅ Found slash command file: .claude/commands/air-begin.md
2. ✅ Renamed to .claude/commands/air-task.md
3. ✅ Updated description from "Start AIR-tracked work session" to "Create and start new AIR task"
4. ✅ Created task file for tracking

## Files Changed
-  →  (renamed)
- Updated description in front matter

## Outcome
✅ Success

Users can now use /air-task instead of /air-begin:
- More semantic and clear
- Better discoverability
- Aligns with air task new command

## Notes
The slash command behavior remains the same - it creates a task file and tracks work. Only the name and description changed for clarity.
