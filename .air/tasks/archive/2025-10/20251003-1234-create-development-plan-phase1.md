## Date
2025-10-03 12:34 UTC

## Prompt
Make a plan for developing the next step.

## Actions Taken
1. Reviewed PROJECT-STATUS.md to understand current implementation state
2. Identified Phase 1 as highest priority (core commands: init, validate, status)
3. Created TodoWrite task list with 9 steps
4. Developed detailed implementation plan with time estimates
5. Outlined success criteria for Phase 1 MVP

## Files Changed
- None (planning only)

## Outcome
✅ Success

Created comprehensive development plan for Phase 1 implementation:
- 9-step plan from filesystem service → templates → air init → testing → validate → status
- Estimated 1-2 days (8-16 hours) total
- Clear success criteria defined
- Identified dependencies between components

## Notes
Plan focuses on getting core assessment workflow operational: air init → air validate → air status
This establishes foundation for Phase 2 (link repositories, task tracking commands).
