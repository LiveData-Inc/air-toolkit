- Shell completion (air completion)
- Analysis progress indicators
- Writable column in status/link list

## Actions Taken

2. ✅ Reviewed all documentation files
3. ✅ Updated QUICKSTART.md to v0.6.2
   - Added External Library Exclusion section
   - Added HTML Findings Report section
   - Added Shell Completion section
   - Updated Quick Reference table with new commands
   - Updated version references
4. ✅ Updated docs/COMMANDS.md to v0.6.2.post1
   - Updated version and date
   - Added air cache, air completion, air upgrade to TOC
   - Replaced "Shell Completion (Future)" with actual implementation
   - Added External Library Exclusion section
   - Added HTML Findings Report section
5. ✅ Verified README.md is already current (updated during feature implementation)

## Files Updated
- `QUICKSTART.md` - Updated to v0.6.2 with all new features
- `docs/COMMANDS.md` - Updated to v0.6.2.post1 with new commands

## Outcome
✅ Success - All user-facing documentation updated

Documentation now covers:
- Shell completion (air completion install)
- External library exclusion (--include-external flag)
- HTML findings report (--html flag)
- Analysis progress indicators ([X/Y])
- Writable column in status/link list

## Notes
