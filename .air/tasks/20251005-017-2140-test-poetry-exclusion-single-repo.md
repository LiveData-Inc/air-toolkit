# Task: Test .poetry exclusion fix on single repo

## Date
2025-10-05 21:40

## Prompt
Let's perform a smaller test - the cloud-native-architecture repo links 19 others and `air analyze -all` takes 7 minutes to run. Instead, try creating a new air project in a temp folder and just run analyze on a single repo: /Users/gpeddle/repos/github/LiveData-Inc/meditech-rpa-cdk

## Actions Taken
1. Created temp AIR project in /tmp/air-test-exclusion/test-exclusion
2. Linked meditech-rpa-cdk repo for testing
3. Ran initial analysis - found .poetry references in security findings
4. Discovered 5 more methods missing path filters across 4 analyzers
5. Applied fixes to all affected methods
6. Re-ran analysis with cache cleared - verified no .poetry/.venv references

## Files Changed
(Changes were made to the main air-toolkit codebase, listed in task 016)

## Outcome
✅ Success

Test confirmed the fix works:
- Created temp project successfully
- Before fix: 35 findings with .poetry references
- After fix: 22 findings, zero .poetry or .venv references
- All findings now focus on actual project code only

## Notes
- This focused test avoided the 7-minute wait for multi-repo analysis
- Testing on a single repo was sufficient to validate the fix
- The significant drop in findings (35 → 22) shows how much noise was coming from vendor code
- Ready to apply to cloud-native-architecture project
