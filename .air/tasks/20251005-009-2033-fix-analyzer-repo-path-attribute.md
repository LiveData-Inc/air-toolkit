# Task: Fix Analyzer repo_path AttributeError

## Date
2025-10-05 20:33

## Prompt
User reported error when running `air analyze --all`:


## Goal
Fix AttributeError where analyzers were missing the repo_path attribute.

## Problem Analysis
- Analyzers were calling super().__init__(repo_path) which sets resource_path in BaseAnalyzer
- But analyzer code (especially path filtering) was trying to access self.repo_path
- This caused: AttributeError: 'SecurityAnalyzer' object has no attribute 'repo_path'

## Root Cause
When implementing external library exclusion (Task 007), added __init__ methods to all analyzers but forgot to set self.repo_path = repo_path in addition to calling super().__init__()

## Actions Taken
1. ✅ Identified the issue from user's error message
2. ✅ Reviewed BaseAnalyzer which sets self.resource_path
3. ✅ Added self.repo_path = repo_path to all 5 analyzers
4. ✅ Committed and pushed fix

## Files Changed
- src/air/services/analyzers/security.py - Added self.repo_path = repo_path
- src/air/services/analyzers/performance.py - Added self.repo_path = repo_path
- src/air/services/analyzers/quality.py - Added self.repo_path = repo_path
- src/air/services/analyzers/architecture.py - Added self.repo_path = repo_path
- src/air/services/analyzers/code_structure.py - Added self.repo_path = repo_path

## Solution
Each analyzer __init__ now does:


## Outcome
✅ Success - Fixed analyzer initialization

Now both attributes are available:
- self.resource_path (from BaseAnalyzer)
- self.repo_path (for path filtering logic)

## Testing
User can now run: air analyze --all
Analysis should complete without AttributeError

## Notes
This was a regression introduced when adding external library exclusion feature. The analyzers were using self.repo_path for path filtering but we forgot to set it in __init__.
